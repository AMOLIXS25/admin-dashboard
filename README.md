# Admin Dashboard

This is a responsive Admin Dashboard built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. The goal of this project was to practice using modern HTML and CSS layout techniques, especially **CSS Grid** and **flexbox**, to build a visually appealing and functional admin interface.
